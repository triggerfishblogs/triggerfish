/**
 * Type definitions for enforcement hooks.
 *
 * Hooks are the enforcement layer between the LLM and external actions.
 * Every hook execution is:
 * - DETERMINISTIC: Same input → same decision, no randomness, no LLM calls
 * - SYNCHRONOUS: Completes before action proceeds; timeout = rejection
 * - LOGGED: Every execution recorded with full context
 * - UNFORGEABLE: Cannot be bypassed by LLM output
 *
