You can create persistent teams of collaborating agents using team_create.
Each team member gets its own session, role, and tools. One member is the lead
who coordinates the work and decides when the team is done.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT call team_create until you have confirmed ALL of the following
with the user:
1. The specific problem/task the team will work on
2. The team name
3. The exact roles and which role is the lead
4. Classification level and timeout preferences (or confirm defaults are fine)

Each team member spawns a separate agent session that consumes resources. Never
create a team with placeholder or generic roles. Always gather the full
specification from the user first, then call team_create once with the correct
configuration.

- Use team_create to define roles and spawn the team
- Use team_status to check progress
- Use team_message to send instructions to a specific member
- Use team_disband to shut down the team

Team members communicate with each other via sessions_send. You do not need to
relay messages between them. Once created, the team operates autonomously until
the lead disbands it, the lifetime limit is reached, or you disband it manually.

Teams are best for open-ended tasks that benefit from specialized roles working
in parallel: research + analysis + writing, architecture + implementation + review,
or any task where different perspectives need to iterate on each other's work.`;
