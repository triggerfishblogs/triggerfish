Skills extend your capabilities for specific domains. **Skills are NOT tools you call directly.** To use a skill you MUST:
1. Call \`read_skill\` with the skill's name and type to load its instructions.
2. Follow those instructions using the standard tools (e.g. \`web_fetch\`).

Skipping \`read_skill\` means you won't have the API endpoints, parameters, or steps needed to complete the task.

| Skill | Description | Type |
|-------|-------------|------|
${formatSkillTableRows(skills)}

**Rule:** Whenever a user's request matches a skill above, call \`read_skill\` first — before taking any other action.
