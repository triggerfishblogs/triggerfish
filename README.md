## 🌊 Quick Install

One command. That's it.

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greghavens/triggerfish/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greghavens/triggerfish/master/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Docker:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greghavens/triggerfish/master/deploy/docker/install.sh | sh
```

The binary installers download a pre-built release, verify its checksum, and run
the setup wizard. The Docker installer pulls the container image, installs a
`triggerfish` CLI wrapper, and runs the setup wizard. See the
[Installation & Deployment guide](https://trigger.fish/guide/installation)
for Docker setup, building from source, and the release process.

## 🔒 Security Model

Triggerfish enforces security **below** the LLM layer. The AI cannot bypass,
modify, or influence policy decisions.

| Principle                  | How It Works                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🏷️ **Classification**      | Every piece of data carries a sensitivity label: `PUBLIC`, `INTERNAL`, `CONFIDENTIAL`, or `RESTRICTED`       |
| 🎨 **Taint Propagation**   | Sessions absorb the classification of data they touch. Taint only escalates, never decreases                 |
| 🚫 **No Write-Down**       | `CONFIDENTIAL` data can never flow to a `PUBLIC` channel. The policy engine blocks it before the LLM sees it |
| ⚙️ **Deterministic Hooks** | Policy decisions are pure functions. No LLM calls, no randomness. Same input → same decision                 |
| 📋 **Audit Trail**         | Every policy decision is logged with full context: timestamp, hook, session, input, result                   |

## 💬 Channels

Triggerfish connects to your existing messaging platforms. Each channel has its
own classification level and owner settings.

| Channel          | Default Classification |
| ---------------- | :--------------------: |
| 💻 CLI           |       `INTERNAL`       |
| ✈️ Telegram      |       `INTERNAL`       |
| 🔒 Signal        |        `PUBLIC`        |
| 💼 Slack         |        `PUBLIC`        |
| 🎮 Discord       |        `PUBLIC`        |
| 📱 WhatsApp      |        `PUBLIC`        |
| 🌐 WebChat       |        `PUBLIC`        |
| 📧 Email         |     `CONFIDENTIAL`     |
| 💬 Google Chat   |        `PUBLIC`        |

> **Note:** All classifications are configurable. Set any channel to any level
> in your `triggerfish.yaml`.

## 🔗 Integrations

### GitHub

Connect GitHub with a single command:

```bash
triggerfish connect github
```

This gives the agent 14 built-in tools for repos, PRs, issues, Actions, and code
search — all with classification-aware taint propagation (public repos =
PUBLIC, private = CONFIDENTIAL).

For the full development feedback loop (agent creates branches, opens PRs,
responds to code review), Triggerfish also supports webhooks and the `gh` CLI:

| Component                       | Role                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Built-in `github_*` tools**   | REST API access to repos, PRs, issues, Actions, search |
| **Webhooks**                    | Receive PR review events from GitHub in real time      |
| **`gh` CLI via exec**           | Create PRs, comment, merge from the agent              |
| **git-branch-management skill** | Teaches the agent the full branch/PR/review workflow   |

See the [GitHub integration docs](https://trigger.fish/integrations/github) for full setup
instructions.

### Google Workspace

```bash
triggerfish connect google
```

## 🧩 Platform Capabilities

### Workflow Engine

Built-in [CNCF Serverless Workflow](https://serverlessworkflow.io/) DSL engine
for orchestrating multi-step automations. Workflows support self-healing
(automatic error recovery), version management, and can be triggered by
schedules, webhooks, or agent decisions.

### Exec Environment

Isolated code execution sandbox where the agent writes, runs, and debugs its own
code in a tight write→run→fix feedback loop. Each agent gets an isolated
workspace directory with controlled process spawning.

### MCP Support

Full [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) client with a
policy-enforced proxy layer. Connect external MCP servers and all tool calls
flow through the same classification and taint enforcement as built-in tools.

### Plugin System

Extend Triggerfish with plugins running in a Pyodide (WASM) sandbox. The plugin
SDK provides a safe, isolated execution environment with a namespace registry
for tool discovery.
