# Configuration

Triggerfish is configured through a single YAML file at
`~/.triggerfish/triggerfish.yaml`. The setup wizard (`triggerfish dive`) creates
this file for you, but you can edit it manually at any time.

## Config File Location

```
~/.triggerfish/triggerfish.yaml
```

You can set individual values from the command line using dotted paths:

```bash
triggerfish config set <key> <value>
triggerfish config get <key>
```

Boolean and integer values are auto-coerced. Secrets are masked in output.

Validate your configuration with:

```bash
triggerfish config validate
```

## Models

The `models` section configures your LLM providers and failover behavior.

```yaml
models:
  # Which provider and model to use by default
  primary:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

  # Optional: vision model for automatic image description when primary
  # model lacks vision support
  # vision: gemini-2.0-flash

  # Streaming responses (default: true)
  # streaming: true

  providers:
    anthropic:
      model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

    openai:
      model: gpt-4o

    google:
      model: gemini-2.5-pro

    ollama:
      model: llama3
      endpoint: "http://localhost:11434" # Ollama default

    lmstudio:
      model: lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF
      endpoint: "http://localhost:1234" # LM Studio default

    openrouter:
      model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5

    zenmux:
      model: openai/gpt-5

    zai:
      model: glm-4.7

  # Failover chain: if primary fails, try these in order
  failover:
    - openai
    - google
```

API keys are stored in the OS keychain, not in this file. The setup wizard
(`triggerfish dive`) prompts for your API key and stores it securely. Ollama and
LM Studio are local and require no authentication.

## Channels

The `channels` section defines which messaging platforms your agent connects to
and the classification level for each.

```yaml
channels:
  cli:
    enabled: true
    classification: INTERNAL

  telegram:
    enabled: true
    ownerId: 123456789
    classification: INTERNAL

  signal:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: "tcp://127.0.0.1:7583"
    account: "+14155552671"
    classification: PUBLIC
    defaultGroupMode: mentioned-only

  slack:
    enabled: true
    classification: PUBLIC

  discord:
    enabled: true
    ownerId: "your-discord-user-id"
    classification: PUBLIC

  whatsapp:
    enabled: true
    phoneNumberId: "your-phone-number-id"
    classification: PUBLIC

  webchat:
    enabled: true
    classification: PUBLIC
    port: 18790

  email:
    enabled: true
    imapHost: "imap.gmail.com"
    smtpApiUrl: "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send"
    imapUser: "you@gmail.com"
    fromAddress: "bot@example.com"
    ownerEmail: "you@gmail.com"
    classification: CONFIDENTIAL
```

Tokens, passwords, and API keys for each channel are stored in the OS keychain.
Run `triggerfish config add-channel <name>` to enter credentials interactively
-- they are saved to the keychain, never to this file.

### Channel Configuration Keys

Non-secret configuration in `triggerfish.yaml`:

| Channel  | Config Keys                                                    | Optional Keys                                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI      | `enabled`                                                      | `classification`                                                        |
| Telegram | `enabled`, `ownerId`                                           | `classification`                                                        |
| Signal   | `enabled`, `endpoint`, `account`                               | `classification`, `defaultGroupMode`, `groups`, `ownerPhone`, `pairing` |
| Slack    | `enabled`                                                      | `classification`, `ownerId`                                             |
| Discord  | `enabled`, `ownerId`                                           | `classification`                                                        |
| WhatsApp | `enabled`, `phoneNumberId`                                     | `classification`, `ownerPhone`, `webhookPort`                           |
| WebChat  | `enabled`                                                      | `classification`, `port`, `allowedOrigins`                              |
| Email    | `enabled`, `smtpApiUrl`, `imapHost`, `imapUser`, `fromAddress` | `classification`, `ownerEmail`, `imapPort`, `pollInterval`              |

Secrets (bot tokens, API keys, passwords, signing secrets) are entered during
channel setup and stored in the OS keychain.

### Default Classification Levels

| Channel  | Default        |
| -------- | -------------- |
| CLI      | `INTERNAL`     |
| Telegram | `INTERNAL`     |
| Signal   | `PUBLIC`       |
| Slack    | `PUBLIC`       |
| Discord  | `PUBLIC`       |
| WhatsApp | `PUBLIC`       |
| WebChat  | `PUBLIC`       |
| Email    | `CONFIDENTIAL` |

All defaults are configurable. Set any channel to any classification level.

## MCP Servers

Connect external MCP servers to give your agent access to additional tools. See
[MCP Gateway](/integrations/mcp-gateway) for the full security model.

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  github:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: "keychain:github-pat"
    classification: CONFIDENTIAL

  filesystem:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/you/docs"]
    classification: INTERNAL
```

Each server must have a `classification` level or it will be rejected (default
deny). Use `command` + `args` for local servers (spawned as subprocesses) or
`url` for remote servers (HTTP SSE). Environment values prefixed with
`keychain:` are resolved from the OS keychain.

For help choosing classification levels, see the
[Classification Guide](./classification-guide).

## Classification

The `classification` section controls how Triggerfish classifies and protects
data.

```yaml
classification:
  mode: personal # "personal" or "enterprise" (coming soon)
```

**Classification levels:**

| Level          | Description     | Examples                                              |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `RESTRICTED`   | Most sensitive  | M&A documents, PII, bank accounts, medical records    |
| `CONFIDENTIAL` | Sensitive       | CRM data, financials, contracts, tax records          |
| `INTERNAL`     | Internal only   | Internal wikis, personal notes, contacts              |
| `PUBLIC`       | Safe for anyone | Marketing materials, public info, general web content |

For detailed guidance on choosing the right level for your integrations,
channels, and MCP servers, see the
[Classification Guide](./classification-guide).

## Policy

The `policy` section configures custom enforcement rules beyond the built-in
protections.

```yaml
policy:
  # Default action when no rule matches
  default_action: ALLOW

  # Custom rules
  rules:
    # Block tool responses containing SSN patterns
    - hook: POST_TOOL_RESPONSE
      conditions:
        - tool_name: "salesforce.*"
        - content_matches: '\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b'
      action: REDACT
      redaction_pattern: "[SSN REDACTED]"
      log_level: ALERT

    # Rate limit external API calls
    - hook: PRE_TOOL_CALL
      conditions:
        - tool_category: external_api
      rate_limit: 100/hour
      action: BLOCK
```

::: info The core security rules -- no write-down, session taint escalation,
audit logging -- are always enforced and cannot be disabled. Custom policy rules
add additional controls on top of these fixed protections. :::

## Web Search & Fetch

The `web` section configures web search and content fetching, including domain
security controls.

```yaml
web:
  search:
    provider: brave # Search backend (brave is currently supported)
    max_results: 10
    safe_search: moderate # off, moderate, strict
  fetch:
    rate_limit: 10 # Requests per minute
    max_content_length: 50000
    timeout: 30000
    default_mode: readability # readability or raw
  domains:
    denylist:
      - "*.malware-site.com"
    allowlist: [] # Empty = allow all (minus denylist)
    classifications:
      - pattern: "*.internal.corp"
        classification: CONFIDENTIAL
```

Set up search from the command line:

```bash
triggerfish config set web.search.provider brave
```

The Brave API key is entered during `triggerfish dive` and stored in the OS
keychain.

::: tip Get a Brave Search API key at
[brave.com/search/api](https://brave.com/search/api/). The free tier includes
2,000 queries/month. :::

## Cron Jobs

Schedule recurring tasks for your agent:

```yaml
cron:
  jobs:
    - id: morning-briefing
      schedule: "0 7 * * *" # 7 AM daily
      task: "Prepare morning briefing with calendar, unread emails, and weather"
      channel: telegram # Where to deliver results
      classification: INTERNAL # Max taint ceiling for this job

    - id: pipeline-check
      schedule: "0 */4 * * *" # Every 4 hours
      task: "Check Salesforce pipeline for changes"
      channel: slack
      classification: CONFIDENTIAL
```

Each cron job runs in its own isolated session with a classification ceiling.
All cron actions pass through the normal policy hooks.

## Trigger Timing

Configure how often your agent performs proactive check-ins:

```yaml
trigger:
  interval: 30m # Check every 30 minutes
  classification: INTERNAL # Max taint ceiling for trigger sessions
  quiet_hours: "22:00-07:00" # Don't trigger during quiet hours
```

The trigger system reads your `~/.triggerfish/TRIGGER.md` file to decide what to
check on each wakeup. See [SPINE and Triggers](./spine-and-triggers) for details
on writing your TRIGGER.md.

## Webhooks

Accept inbound events from external services:

```yaml
webhooks:
  endpoints:
    - id: github-events
      path: /webhook/github
      classification: INTERNAL
      actions:
        - event: "pull_request.opened"
          task: "Review PR and post summary"
        - event: "issues.opened"
          task: "Triage new issue"

    - id: sentry-alerts
      path: /webhook/sentry
      classification: CONFIDENTIAL
      actions:
        - event: "error"
          task: "Investigate error and create fix PR if possible"
```
