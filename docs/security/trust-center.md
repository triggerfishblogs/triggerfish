# Trust Center

Triggerfish enforces security in deterministic code below the LLM layer — not in
prompts the model might ignore. Every policy decision is made by code that
cannot be influenced by prompt injection, social engineering, or model
misbehavior. See the full [Security-First Design](/security/) page for the deep
technical explanation.

## Security Controls

These controls are active in the current release. Each is enforced in code,
tested in CI, and auditable in the open-source repository.

| Control                        | Status                           | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sub-LLM Policy Enforcement     | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | Eight deterministic hooks intercept every action before and after LLM processing. The model cannot bypass, modify, or influence security decisions. |
| Data Classification System     | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | Four-level hierarchy (PUBLIC, INTERNAL, CONFIDENTIAL, RESTRICTED) with mandatory no-write-down enforcement.                                         |
| Session Taint Tracking         | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | Every session tracks the highest classification of data accessed. Taint only escalates, never decreases.                                            |
| Immutable Audit Logging        | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | All policy decisions logged with full context. Audit logging cannot be disabled by any component of the system.                                     |
| Secrets Isolation              | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | Credentials stored in OS keychain or vault. Never in config files, storage, logs, or LLM context.                                                   |
| Plugin Sandboxing              | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | Third-party plugins run in a Deno + WASM double sandbox (Pyodide). No undeclared network access, no data exfiltration.                             |
| Dependency Scanning            | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | Automated vulnerability scanning via GitHub Dependabot. PRs opened automatically for upstream CVEs.                                                 |
| Open Source Codebase           | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | Full security architecture is Apache 2.0 licensed and publicly auditable.                                                                           |
| On-Premises Deployment         | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | Runs entirely on your infrastructure. No cloud dependency, no telemetry, no external data processing.                                               |
| Encryption                     | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | TLS for all data in transit. OS-level encryption at rest. Enterprise vault integration available.                                                   |
| Responsible Disclosure Program | <StatusBadge status="active" />  | Documented vulnerability reporting process with defined response timelines. See [disclosure policy](/security/responsible-disclosure).              |
| Hardened Container Image       | <StatusBadge status="planned" /> | Docker images on Google Distroless base with near-zero CVEs. Automated Trivy scanning in CI.                                                        |

## Defense in Depth — 13 Independent Layers

No single layer is sufficient alone. If one layer is compromised, the remaining
layers continue to protect the system.

| Layer | Name                         | Enforcement                                       |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 01    | Channel Authentication       | Code-verified identity at session establishment   |
| 02    | Permission-Aware Data Access | Source system permissions, not system credentials |
| 03    | Session Taint Tracking       | Automatic, mandatory, escalation-only             |
| 04    | Data Lineage                 | Full provenance chain for every data element      |
| 05    | Policy Enforcement Hooks     | Deterministic, non-bypassable, logged             |
| 06    | MCP Gateway                  | Per-tool permissions, server classification       |

| 10    | Agent Identity & Delegation  | Cryptographic delegation chains                   |
| 11    | Audit Logging                | Cannot be disabled                                |

## Why Sub-LLM Enforcement Matters

::: info Most AI agent platforms enforce security through system prompts —
instructions to the LLM saying "do not share sensitive data." Prompt injection
attacks can override these instructions.

Triggerfish takes a different approach: the LLM has **zero authority** over
security decisions. All enforcement happens in deterministic code below the LLM
layer. There is no pathway from LLM output to security configuration. :::

## Compliance Roadmap

Triggerfish is pre-certification. Our security posture is architectural and
verifiable in source code today. Formal certifications are on the roadmap.

| Certification                | Status                           | Notes                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SOC 2 Type I                 | <StatusBadge status="planned" /> | Security + Confidentiality trust services criteria                |
| SOC 2 Type II                | <StatusBadge status="planned" /> | Sustained control effectiveness over observation period           |
| HIPAA BAA                    | <StatusBadge status="planned" /> | Business associate agreement for healthcare customers             |
| ISO 27001                    | <StatusBadge status="planned" /> | Information security management system                            |
| Third-Party Penetration Test | <StatusBadge status="planned" /> | Independent security assessment                                   |
| GDPR Compliance              | <StatusBadge status="planned" /> | Self-hosted architecture with configurable retention and deletion |

## A Note on Trust

::: tip The security core is open source under Apache 2.0. You can read every
line of policy enforcement code, run the test suite, and verify claims yourself.
Certifications are on the roadmap. :::
