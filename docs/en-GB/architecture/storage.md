# Storage

All stateful data in Triggerfish flows through a unified `StorageProvider`
abstraction. No module creates its own storage mechanism -- every component that
needs persistence takes a `StorageProvider` as a dependency. This design makes
backends swappable without touching business logic and keeps all tests fast and
deterministic.

## StorageProvider Interface

```typescript
interface StorageProvider {
  /** Retrieve a value by key. Returns null if not found. */
  get(key: string): Promise<StorageValue | null>;

  /** Store a value at a key. Overwrites any existing value. */
  set(key: string, value: StorageValue): Promise<void>;

  /** Delete a key. No-op if key does not exist. */
  delete(key: string): Promise<void>;

  /** List all keys matching an optional prefix. */
  list(prefix?: string): Promise<string[]>;

  /** Delete all keys. Use with caution. */
  clear(): Promise<void>;
}
```

::: info `StorageValue` is a string. All structured data (sessions, lineage
records, configuration) is serialised to JSON before storage and deserialised on
read. This keeps the interface simple and backend-agnostic. :::

## Implementations

| Backend                 | Use Case                    | Persistence                                        | Configuration                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `MemoryStorageProvider` | Testing, ephemeral sessions | None (lost on restart)                             | No configuration needed         |
| `SqliteStorageProvider` | Default for personal tier   | SQLite WAL at `~/.triggerfish/data/triggerfish.db` | Zero configuration              |
| Enterprise backends     | Enterprise tier             | Customer-managed                                   | Postgres, S3, or other backends |

### MemoryStorageProvider

Used in all tests for speed and determinism. Data exists only in memory and is
lost when the process exits. Every test suite creates a fresh
`MemoryStorageProvider`, ensuring tests are isolated and reproducible.

### SqliteStorageProvider

The default for personal tier deployments. Uses SQLite in WAL (Write-Ahead
Logging) mode for concurrent read access and crash safety. The database lives
at:

```
~/.triggerfish/data/triggerfish.db
```

SQLite requires no configuration, no server process, and no network. A single
file stores all Triggerfish state. The `@db/sqlite` Deno package provides the
binding, which requires `--allow-ffi` permission.

::: tip SQLite WAL mode allows multiple readers to access the database
concurrently with a single writer. This is important for the Gateway, which may
read session state while the agent is writing tool results. :::

### Enterprise Backends

Enterprise deployments can plug in external storage backends (Postgres, S3,
etc.) without code changes. Any implementation of the `StorageProvider`
interface works. The backend is configured in `triggerfish.yaml`.

## Namespaced Keys

All keys in the storage system are namespaced with a prefix that identifies the
data type. This prevents collisions and makes it possible to query, retain, and
purge data by category.

| Namespace        | Key Pattern                                  | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `sessions:`      | `sessions:sess_abc123`                       | Session state (conversation history, metadata) |
| `taint:`         | `taint:sess_abc123`                          | Session taint level                            |
| `lineage:`       | `lineage:lin_789xyz`                         | Data lineage records (provenance tracking)     |
| `audit:`         | `audit:2025-01-29T10:23:45Z:hook_pre_output` | Audit log entries                              |
| `cron:`          | `cron:job_daily_report`                      | Cron job state and execution history           |
| `notifications:` | `notifications:notif_456`                    | Notification queue                             |
| `exec:`          | `exec:run_789`                               | Agent execution environment history            |
| `skills:`        | `skills:skill_weather`                       | Installed skill metadata                       |
| `config:`        | `config:v3`                                  | Configuration snapshots                        |

## Retention Policies

Each namespace has a default retention policy. Enterprise deployments can
customise these.

| Namespace        | Default Retention         | Rationale                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `sessions:`      | 30 days                   | Conversation history ages out              |
| `taint:`         | Matches session retention | Taint is meaningless without its session   |
| `lineage:`       | 90 days                   | Compliance-driven, audit trail             |
| `audit:`         | 1 year                    | Compliance-driven, legal and regulatory    |
| `cron:`          | 30 days                   | Execution history for debugging            |
| `notifications:` | Until delivered + 7 days  | Undelivered notifications must persist     |
| `exec:`          | 30 days                   | Execution artifacts for debugging          |
| `skills:`        | Permanent                 | Installed skill metadata should not expire |
| `config:`        | 10 versions               | Rolling config history for rollback        |

## Design Principles

### All Modules Use StorageProvider

No module in Triggerfish creates its own storage mechanism. Session management,
taint tracking, lineage recording, audit logging, cron state, notification
queues, execution history, and configuration -- all flow through
`StorageProvider`.

This means:

- Swapping backends requires changing one dependency injection point
- Tests use `MemoryStorageProvider` for speed -- no SQLite setup, no filesystem
- There is exactly one place to implement encryption-at-rest, backup, or
  replication

### Serialisation

All structured data is serialised to JSON strings before storage. The
serialise/deserialise layer handles:

- `Date` objects (serialised as ISO 8601 strings via `toISOString()`,
  deserialised via `new Date()`)
- Branded types (serialised as their underlying string value)
- Nested objects and arrays

```typescript
// Storing a session
const session = {
  id: "sess_abc",
  taint: "CONFIDENTIAL",
  createdAt: new Date(),
};
await storage.set("sessions:sess_abc", JSON.stringify(session));

// Retrieving a session
const raw = await storage.get("sessions:sess_abc");
if (raw) {
  const session = JSON.parse(raw);
  session.createdAt = new Date(session.createdAt); // Restore Date
}
```

### Immutability

Session operations are immutable. Reading a session, modifying it, and writing
it back always produces a new object. Functions never mutate the stored object
in place. This aligns with the broader Triggerfish principle that functions
return new objects and never mutate.

## Directory Structure

```
~/.triggerfish/
  config/          # Agent configuration, SPINE.md, TRIGGER.md
  data/            # triggerfish.db (SQLite)
  workspace/       # Agent exec environment
    <agent-id>/    # Per-agent workspace (persists)
    background/    # Background session workspaces
  skills/          # Installed skills
  logs/            # Audit logs
  secrets/         # Encrypted credential store
```

::: warning SECURITY The `secrets/` directory contains encrypted credentials
managed by the OS keychain integration. Never store secrets in configuration
files or in the `StorageProvider`. Use the OS keychain (personal tier) or vault
integration (enterprise tier). :::
