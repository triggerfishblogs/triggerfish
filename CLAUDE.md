# Triggerfish Development Guide

## Project Overview

Triggerfish is a secure, multi-channel AI agent platform with deterministic policy enforcement below the LLM layer. It combines the integration breadth of a personal AI assistant (voice, browser, cron, skills, multi-channel messaging) with enterprise-grade security controls that the LLM cannot circumvent.

## Technology Stack

- Runtime: Deno 2.x (TypeScript strict mode)
- Python plugins: Pyodide (WASM)
- Testing: Deno's built-in test runner
- Channel libraries: Baileys (WhatsApp), grammY (Telegram), Bolt (Slack), discord.js (Discord)
- Browser automation: puppeteer-core (CDP) — Phase A3
- Web content extraction: Mozilla Readability (npm: specifier) — Phase A1
- Memory search: SQLite FTS5 full-text search — Phase A2
- Voice: Whisper (local STT), ElevenLabs/OpenAI (TTS)
- No external build tools required

## Commands

- `deno task test` — Run all tests
- `deno task test:watch` — Run tests in watch mode
- `deno task test <path>` — Run tests for a specific phase/module
- `deno task lint` — Run linter
- `deno task fmt` — Format code
- `deno task check` — Type check all source files
- `deno task dev` — Run in development mode

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode, no exceptions
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use `readonly` for all immutable properties
- All public APIs must have JSDoc comments
- Error handling: use `Result<T, E>` pattern, not thrown exceptions
- No `any` types allowed anywhere
- Branded types for all IDs (SessionId, UserId, ChannelId)
- Immutable data structures: functions return new objects, never mutate

## Architecture Principles

1. **Deterministic enforcement** — Policy hooks use pure functions, no LLM calls, no randomness. Same input always produces same decision.
2. **Taint propagation** — All data carries classification metadata. Session taint can only escalate, never decrease.
3. **No write-down** — Data cannot flow to a lower classification level. CONFIDENTIAL data cannot reach a PUBLIC channel.
4. **Audit everything** — All policy decisions logged with full context: timestamp, hook type, session ID, input, result, rules evaluated.
5. **Hooks are unforgeable** — The LLM cannot bypass, modify, or influence policy hook decisions. Hooks run in code below the LLM layer.
6. **Session isolation** — Each session tracks taint independently. Background sessions spawn with fresh PUBLIC taint. Agent workspaces are fully isolated.
7. **SSRF prevention** — All outbound HTTP (web_fetch, browser.navigate) resolves DNS first and checks against a hardcoded IP denylist. Private/reserved ranges always blocked. Not configurable.
8. **Memory classification gating** — Cross-session memory writes are forced to session taint level. Reads filtered by `canFlowTo`. The LLM cannot choose what classification a memory is stored at.
9. **Default deny** — Integrations, plugins, and channels must have a classification level configured or they are rejected. Built-in tools are ungated. External data sources are never silently allowed without classification.

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for hook chains
- Property-based tests for classification logic
- All tests must be deterministic (no flaky tests)
- TDD: write tests before implementation when possible
- Each phase has a specific test path (see PHASE_BREAKDOWN.md)
- Phase A2 has 10 critical classification boundary tests — these are the most important tests in the entire Phase A

## File Organization

- One concept per file
- Export via `mod.ts` barrel files per module
- Tests adjacent to source: `foo.ts` → `foo_test.ts`
- Flat file structure within each module directory — no nested subdirectories
- No relative path references across module boundaries — use barrel imports

## Ralph Wiggum Loop Integration

This project uses the Ralph Wiggum loop methodology for autonomous implementation. Each phase has:
- A SPEC file defining object models, interfaces, and exit criteria
- A PROMPT file for the loop iteration
- A completion token: `<promise>PHASE_N_COMPLETE</promise>` (or `PHASE_A1_COMPLETE` etc.)
- A failure token: `<promise>NEEDS_HUMAN</promise>` (document issue in BLOCKERS.md)

On each iteration: read the prompt, check current state, implement or fix, run tests, emit completion token if all tests pass.

## Key Domain Concepts

- **Classification** — Data sensitivity level (RESTRICTED > CONFIDENTIAL > INTERNAL > PUBLIC)
- **Taint** — Session-level classification that escalates as classified data is accessed
- **Write-down** — Prohibited flow of data to a lower classification level
- **Hook** — Deterministic enforcement point in the data flow (PRE_CONTEXT_INJECTION, PRE_TOOL_CALL, POST_TOOL_RESPONSE, PRE_OUTPUT, etc.)
- **Gateway** — WebSocket control plane managing sessions, channels, tools, and events
- **Exec Environment** — Agent's code workspace for writing, running, and debugging code in a tight write→run→fix feedback loop (distinct from Plugin Sandbox which protects FROM untrusted code)
- **Workspace** — Per-agent filesystem directory where the agent writes and executes its own code
- **Session** — Fundamental unit of conversation state with independent taint tracking
- **Skill** — Folder with SKILL.md giving the agent new capabilities (bundled, managed, or workspace)
- **Buoy** — Companion app providing device capabilities (camera, location, etc.)
- **Trigger** — Periodic agent wakeup for proactive autonomous behavior, configured via TRIGGER.md
- **SPINE.md** — Agent identity & mission file (system prompt foundation). Triggerfish's equivalent of CLAUDE.md
- **TRIGGER.md** — Agent's proactive behavior definition: what to check, monitor, and act on during trigger wakeups
- **Tide Pool** — Visual workspace rendered via A2UI (Agent-to-UI) protocol
- **Patrol** — Diagnostic health check command (`triggerfish patrol`)
- **Dive** — First-run setup wizard (`triggerfish dive`), scaffolds SPINE.md and triggerfish.yaml
- **Ripple** — Typing indicators and online status signals
- **The Reef** — Skill marketplace for discovering, installing, and publishing skills
- **SSRF** — Server-Side Request Forgery. Prevented by hardcoded IP denylist checked after DNS resolution on all outbound HTTP (web_fetch + browser.navigate)
- **Domain classification mapping** — Maps domain patterns to classification floors. PRE_TOOL_CALL blocks access when domain classification exceeds session channel classification. Configured in `web.domains.classifications` in triggerfish.yaml.
- **Memory shadowing** — When the same user-facing memory key exists at multiple classification levels, only the highest-classified version visible to the current session is returned
- **Auto-extraction** — Prompt-level behavior (via SPINE.md) where the agent proactively calls `memory_save` to persist facts. LLM picks WHAT to save, policy forces AT WHAT LEVEL.
- **Auto-injection** — Opt-in feature that injects relevant memories into session context at start. Respects classification gating.
- **Browser profile watermark** — Highest classification at which an agent's browser profile has been used. Escalation only. Lower sessions blocked from higher-watermarked profiles.
- **SearchProvider** — Interface for web search backends (Brave default). Extensible to SearXNG, Google, etc.
- **MemoryStore** — Classification-gated CRUD over StorageProvider for cross-session memory
- **MemorySearchProvider** — FTS5 full-text search interface over memory records with classification filtering and shadowing

## MCP Servers for Development

When using Claude Code on this project, configure these MCP servers:
- desktop-commander — file and process operations
- context7 — documentation lookup
- ESLint — linting integration
- Deno executor — run Deno commands

## Git Rules

- Only push a commit if you are EXPLICITLY asked to. Never push unless the user specifically says to push.
- When asked to stash files, stash ALL FILES THAT HAVE CHANGED. Not just ones you think you changed. Always use `git stash push -u` to catch everything including untracked files.

## What NOT to Do

- Never use `any` types
- Never throw exceptions for expected failures (use Result)
- Never mutate session state (always return new objects)
- Never make LLM calls inside policy hooks
- Never allow the LLM to influence hook decisions
- Never store secrets in config files (use OS keychain or env vars)
- Never expose the Gateway WebSocket to the public internet without auth
- Never use raw `Map` or in-memory structures for data that must survive restarts — use StorageProvider
- Never implement ad-hoc "notify owner" logic — use NotificationService
- Never hardcode a single LLM provider — use LlmProvider interface
- Never duplicate domain security config — `src/web/domains.ts` is the single source of truth for SSRF, allowlist, denylist, and classification mappings. Browser imports from there.
- Never let the LLM choose memory classification — always force to `session.taint` in PRE_TOOL_CALL
- Never allow memory reads above session taint — filter by `canFlowTo` in every query
- Never skip DNS resolution before outbound HTTP — SSRF prevention requires checking resolved IP, not just hostname
- Never default to ALLOW — if a tool, integration, or path has no classification or permission configured, the default must always be DENY. Silently allowing unclassified operations is a security violation
- Never hardcode plugin or integration names in core code — integrations are loaded by config. Core code uses generic dispatch (prefix maps, executor chains), not per-integration if-blocks
- Never put session management (taint escalation, classification enforcement) inside plugins — enforcement belongs in the centralized orchestrator tool executor wrapper, not in individual tool handlers
- Never put shared logic in interface-specific directories — `src/cli/` is for CLI only, `src/channels/telegram/` is for Telegram only, etc. Notification delivery, session management, scheduling, and any cross-cutting logic belongs in `src/gateway/` or the appropriate core module. Interface directories contain only adapter/UI code and wiring.
